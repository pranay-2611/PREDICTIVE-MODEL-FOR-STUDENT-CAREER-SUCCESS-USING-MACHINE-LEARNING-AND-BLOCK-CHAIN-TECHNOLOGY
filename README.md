**Predictive Model for Student Career Success Using Machine Learning and Blockchain Technology**



## 📖 Project Description<br>
This project aims to develop an intelligent system that predicts student career success based on academic performance, technical skills, certifications, internships, and behavioral factors. Machine Learning algorithms analyze historical data to generate accurate career predictions, while Blockchain technology ensures secure, tamper-proof storage and verification of academic records.

## 🎯 Problem Statement<br>
Students often struggle to choose the right career path due to lack of personalized guidance and reliable data insights. Traditional career counseling methods are not data-driven and may overlook individual strengths. Additionally, academic records can be altered or misrepresented.<br>
This project addresses these challenges by:

* Predicting suitable career paths using Machine Learning.<br>
* Securing academic and certification data using Blockchain.<br>
* Providing transparent and trustworthy career recommendations.<br>

## 💡 Proposed Solution<br>

The system:<br>

1. Collects student academic and skill-based data.<br>
2. Uses Machine Learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) to predict career success probability.<br>
3. Stores verified credentials on a Blockchain network.<br>
4. Provides personalized career recommendations with confidence scores.<br>
